# Dev log

Newest first. Each entry: what landed, numbers, anything left open (which also goes on the
roadmap's "Open" list). Keep it short; it's how the next session (human or agent) picks up.
Headings end with the branch that wrote them (`general-manager` or `recipe-developer`,
[working-together.md](working-together.md)).

Archives: [October 2026](devlog-2026-10.md), [November 1–14](devlog-2026-11.md).

## 2026-11-14 (night): a clear-out for working live (general-manager)

**What changed:** the roadmap no longer plans phases: it says what EasyCAD does today, the
decisions that stand, one **Open** list split by owner (app / recipes), and what's for later.
The dev log's November entries moved to `devlog-2026-11.md` (their open items are on the
roadmap now), and `CLAUDE.md`'s phase history became a short "where we are".

## 2026-11-14 (night): two agents, two branches (general-manager)

**What changed:** the owner split the work between two agents on long-lived branches:
`general-manager` (the app and its architecture: engine, language, app UI, G-code safety, build,
CI) and `recipe-developer` (templates, the owner's projects, tuning and test prints). The old
session branch is gone. Written down in `docs/working-together.md` (who owns which files, how a
recipe asks for a new step, merging `origin/main` before every task and every pull request,
conflicts, dev log entries ending with the branch), `CLAUDE.md` (collaboration workflow, read
order) and the README.
